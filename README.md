# Motorcycle-Sales

I've been using open source sales data on a company that sells motorcycle parts. They operate multiple warehouses, selling both retail and wholesale. They offer a variety of parts and accept credit cards, cash, and bank transfer as payment methods. However, each payment type incurs a different fee.

This project will give the board of directors a better understanding of wholesale revenue by product line, and how this varies month-to-month and across warehouses. I have calculated net revenue for each product line and grouping results by month and warehouse, and have decided to filter to only look at wholesale orders.
